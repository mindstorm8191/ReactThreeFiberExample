## React-Three-Fiber Example

React-Three-Fiber is a library that allows you to create Three.js scenes using React commands.
Check out the Git here: https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber

React-Three-Fiber has a bunch of demos to show you what it is capable of, and they're great.
But they don't show you how to do basic things. This is what this example app is for.

This example shows you how to create a basic scene, and load models (from Blender) and
textures. We are even able to rotate our model.
